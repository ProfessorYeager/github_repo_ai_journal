# Squad Goals & Sweat: Building Guilds & Workouts 🛡️💪

**Date:** November 22, 2025  
**Mood:** Pumped 😤  
**Category:** Feature Drop 🚀

## The Vision
It's not enough to just workout alone. An RPG needs a party! Today I shipped two MASSIVE features to bring the community together and make tracking workouts feel epic.

## 🛡️ Guilds System
I finally built the **Guilds** infrastructure! Now users can:
-   **Create their own Guilds**: "Iron Legion", "Shadow Runners", you name it.
-   **Join Forces**: Team up with friends to boost your stats.
-   **Premium Perks**: Only "Hero Tier" members can found a guild (gotta have that monetization strategy! 💸).

I used a `mockGuilds` array for now to test the UI, but the architecture is ready for the backend. The UI looks slick with a gradient header and dynamic stats.

## 🏋️ Active Workout Session
I also polished the **Workout Logger**.
-   Added `ActiveWorkoutSession.tsx` to handle live tracking.
-   Refined the `WorkoutLogger` component to be more intuitive.

## Code Highlight
Here's how I handled the Guild creation logic with a premium check:

```typescript
const handleCreate = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (!activeCharacter || !user) return;

    // Premium check?
    if (!user.isPremium) {
        alert("Only Hero Tier members can create guilds!");
        return;
    }
    // ... creation logic
};
```

## What's Next?
Connecting these guilds to real-time challenges. Imagine a "Guild Raid" where the boss takes damage based on how many miles your guild runs! 🏃‍♂️💨
