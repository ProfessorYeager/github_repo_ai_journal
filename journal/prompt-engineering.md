## How to Talk to AI

Working with AI agents like Antigravity is a skill. It's not just about asking questions; it's about **context** and **intent**.

### Key Lessons

1.  **Be Specific**: Don't say "fix the code." Say "fix the null pointer exception in the `User` class when logging in."
2.  **Provide Context**: If you're working on a specific file, mention it. If you have a specific design in mind, describe it (e.g., "Slate Blue and Minty Green").
3.  **Iterate**: It's okay if the first result isn't perfect. Give feedback. "That's good, but can we make the button rounder?"

### The "Role" Technique

Tell the AI who it is.
> "You are a senior frontend engineer specializing in accessibility..."

This sets the tone and quality of the output.

### Code Snippets

When asking for code, specify the language and framework.

\`\`\`javascript
// Good prompt example
function createButton(label) {
  // "Create a accessible button component in React with Tailwind styling"
}
\`\`\`

Keep experimenting!
