# Project Deep Dive: RPG Fitness App

**Date:** November 22, 2025  
**Category:** Architecture 🏗️

## The Mission
I'm building an app to gamify fitness, turning workouts into RPG quests. Today, I took a look under the hood at the tech stack we've chosen.

## The Stack
We are keeping it modern and fast:

-   **Core**: React 19 + Vite (Bleeding edge! 🩸)
-   **State Management**: Zustand (Simple, scalable, no boilerplate)
-   **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4 (The latest and greatest)
-   **Routing**: React Router 7
-   **Icons**: Lucide React

## Why this stack?
The combination of **Vite** and **React 19** ensures an incredibly fast dev loop. **Zustand** is perfect for managing complex game state (like XP, Level, and Inventory) without the complexity of Redux.

## Next Steps
I need to start building out the "Character Sheet" component. It's time to turn those stats into code!
