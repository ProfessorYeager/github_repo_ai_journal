# Welcome to My AI Journal

**Date:** November 22, 2025  
**Mood:** Excited 🚀

## The Beginning

This journal marks the start of my journey into deep collaboration with AI agents. I'm using **Antigravity**, a powerful tool that allows me to pair program with advanced AI models.

### Goals

1.  **Build Cool Stuff**: I want to create apps that are not just functional but "wow" people.
2.  **Learn Fast**: Use AI to accelerate my learning of new frameworks and languages.
3.  **Document Everything**: Keep a record of what works, what doesn't, and the "aha!" moments.

### The Setup

This journal itself is built with:
-   **HTML5/CSS3**: For a clean, semantic structure.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript**: No heavy frameworks, just pure speed.
-   **Markdown**: For easy writing of entries.
-   **GitHub Pages**: for hosting (eventually).

Stay tuned for more updates as I build my first real app!
